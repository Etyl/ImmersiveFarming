Soil Fertility
A nice soil

Having soil with low fertility will slow down crop growth.

Switching to a different crop when replanting improves growth speed.

You can boost the fertility of a soil tile by right clicking it with compost.
Once a crop grows on a fertilized tile, it will consume the fertilization, and the tile will need to be fertilized again.
