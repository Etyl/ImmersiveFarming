Crop Diseases
Keep 'em healthy !

When growing, crops have a chance of becoming sick and will contaminate adjacent crops over time.
Contaminated crops will have small flies around them (small black particles). After some time, contaminated crops will eventually die, giving no yield.

In order to prevent and treat crops, you can use treated water instead of water with your sprinklers.
