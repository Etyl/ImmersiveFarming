# Description

Immersive Farming is an addon for Immersive Engineering focusing on improving the farming experience. Players will be able to craft sprinklers, to better irrigate their crops and make pesticides to prevent their crops from getting sick and dying. Immersive Farming also introduces several new mechanics that change vanilla farming.

Thanks to Peter for creating the assets !

# Features

* Irrigation
  * Sprinklers! Sprinklers can be crafted in order to irrigate crops (6 block radius for the regular and 12 blocks for the high pressure one)
  * Sprinklers need to be fed with water or treated water in order to function. The water can be inputed and output on the bottom part of the block using a hammer (to configure input or output) and pipes
  * Water tiles only irrigate the adjacent farmland tiles
* Crop disease
  * Crops can become sick and will contaminate adjacent crops and eventually die
  * Using treated water in the sprinklers will prevent and cure diseases
* Farmland
  * Farmland can no longer be trampled by jumping on it
  * Bone meal can no longer be used on crops
  * Tilling dirt now requires several clicks (but better hoes speed up this process)
